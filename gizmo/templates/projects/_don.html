	<h2>About Don</h2>
	<p>Don is a programmer and technology architect who specializes in database driven web applications. After a stint in Hollywood creating special effects, and while still on the West Coast, he implemented interactive media projects for Disney Imagineering and Knowledge Adventure. Since the turn of the century, on the East Cost, with Juliet Jacobson as DigitalGizmo, Don has programmed numerous award-winning sites. All have employed web application frameworks &mdash; many built with Java and Struts, though recent sites have been built with Python and Django. All have used extensive database back-ends, and most have interactive features using, for instance, JavaScript. Don&apos;s key strength is his ability to understand the client&apos;s and designer&apos;s vision and translate that into reality using the most appropriate technologies.</p>
